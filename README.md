= Auto Download Inputs = 
If you want to use my code to auto-download inputs, you can steal the function here - Utils.DownloadInputs()
It requires a Session ID.  If you are using my whole repo, it grabs it from a session.txt file that sits next to the sln file, otherwise you can add it however you want.
To lookup your session id,
 - In Chrome, go to AOC
 - Right-click, inspect page
 - Click the 'Application' tab.  Look for the 'session' key
